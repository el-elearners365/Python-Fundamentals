    "# Dry Run\n",
    "A dry run is a technique used in programming to manually step through code execution without actually running the code on a computer. It helps programmers understand how the code behaves, identifies any errors or unexpected behavior, and verifies the correctness of the logic. Dry runs are often done on paper or using a whiteboard, where the programmer manually executes each statement of the code and keeps track of variables and their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through an example of a dry run for a simple Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Finding the Maximum Element in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following Python code that finds the maximum element in a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_max(lst):\n",
    "    if not lst:  # If the list is empty\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    max_element = lst[0]  # Initialize max_element with the first element\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for num in lst:\n",
    "        if num > max_element:\n",
    "            max_element = num  # Update max_element if a larger number is found\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return max_element\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the function\n",
    "numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5]\n",
    "print(find_max(numbers))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's do a dry run of this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:** `numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5]`\n",
    "2. **Step 1:** Initialize `max_element` to the first element of the list: `max_element = 3`.\n",
    "3. **Step 2:** Start iterating through the list:\n",
    "   - **Iteration 1:** `num = 3`, which is not greater than `max_element`, so no change.\n",
    "   - **Iteration 2:** `num = 7`, which is greater than `max_element`, so `max_element` becomes `7`.\n",
    "   - **Iteration 3:** `num = 2`, which is not greater than `max_element`, so no change.\n",
    "   - **Iteration 4:** `num = 9`, which is greater than `max_element`, so `max_element` becomes `9`.\n",
    "   - **Iteration 5:** `num = 5`, which is not greater than `max_element`, so no change.\n",
    "4. **Step 3:** Return the final value of `max_element`, which is `9`.\n",
    "5. **Output:** `9`\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing a dry run, we can verify that the code correctly finds the maximum element in the list `[3, 7, 2, 9, 5]`, and we understand how the program behaves for different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dry runs are a valuable tool for understanding code behavior, especially for complex algorithms or code segments where manual inspection can reveal insights that automated testing might miss."
