    "## Introduction to Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are ordered collections of items, just like lists, but they are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()` and elements are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Tuples\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating an empty tuple\n",
    "empty_tuple = ()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tuple with elements\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Elements\n",
    "Elements in a tuple can be accessed using indexing, just like in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing elements using positive indexing\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(my_tuple[3])  # Output: a\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing elements using negative indexing\n",
    "print(my_tuple[-1]) # Output: c\n",
    "print(my_tuple[-3]) # Output: a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuple Functions and Methods\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, so they have fewer methods compared to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `len()`\n",
    "Returns the number of items in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "print(len(numbers))  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `index()`\n",
    "Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c', 3)\n",
    "print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `count()`\n",
    "Returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c', 3)\n",
    "print(my_tuple.count(3))  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuple Packing and Unpacking\n",
    "Tuple packing is the process of packing multiple values into a single tuple. Tuple unpacking is the process of extracting values from a tuple into individual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tuple packing\n",
    "my_tuple = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple unpacking\n",
    "a, b, c = my_tuple\n",
    "print(a)  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(c)  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Tuples\n",
    "- Immutable: Once created, tuples cannot be modified, providing data integrity.\n",
    "- Faster than lists: Tuples are generally faster than lists, especially for iteration and accessing elements.\n",
    "- Valid keys in dictionaries: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Tuples are immutable collections of elements in Python. They are useful for representing fixed collections of items and for ensuring data integrity when the content should not be modified. While they have fewer methods compared to lists, tuples are efficient and versatile data structures in Python."
