    "# Loops\n",
    "Loops are essential control flow structures in Python that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. Let's explore both types along with their use cases, syntax, and examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `for` Loops\n",
    "`for` loops are used when you know the number of iterations beforehand or want to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code block to be executed for each iteration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `while` Loops\n",
    "`while` loops are used when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code block to be executed as long as the condition is true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i <= 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Control Statements\n",
    "Python provides several loop control statements to modify the execution of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `break`\n",
    "The `break` statement terminates the loop prematurely, even if the loop condition is still true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    if fruit == \"banana\":\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `continue`\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    if fruit == \"banana\":\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `else` Clause with Loops\n",
    "Python allows you to use an `else` clause with loops, which is executed when the loop completes normally (i.e., without encountering a `break` statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop completed\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Loops\n",
    "You can nest loops within each other to perform more complex iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "adj = [\"red\", \"big\", \"tasty\"]\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for a in adj:\n",
    "    for b in fruits:\n",
    "        print(a, b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehensions with Loops\n",
    "List comprehensions offer a concise way to create lists using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]\n",
    "print(squared_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over Dictionary Keys, Values, and Items\n",
    "You can use loops to iterate over dictionary keys, values, or key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n",
    "for key in my_dict:\n",
    "    print(key, my_dict[key])\n",
    "\n",
    "for value in my_dict.values():\n",
    "    print(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "for key, value in my_dict.items():\n",
    "    print(key, value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Loops are powerful constructs in Python that allow you to execute code repeatedly. Whether you're iterating over sequences, performing calculations, or processing data, loops provide a versatile way to automate repetitive tasks efficiently. By understanding the syntax and usage of `for` loops and `while` loops, along with loop control statements and list comprehensions, you can write more expressive and concise code in Python."
